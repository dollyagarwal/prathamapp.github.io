### About Pratham Digital

On 29th August 2017 in New Delhi, Pratham unveiled its latest innovation - PraDigi. In addition to providing tablets to rural communities, this digital initiative includes a learning app that offers children high-quality, interactive content to improve their basic literacy and numeracy skills, support their subject-specific competencies, and promote their ability to think critically and work collaboratively. Learning content for preschoolers, primary school children and upper primary school children is available in major Indian languages including Punjabi, Assamese, Bengali, Odiya, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi and English.

Pratham Digital has produced over 1700 videos and 200 learning games in the last few years. These resources can be viewed on www.prathamopenschool.org. 
These resources have been deployed and monitored in many rural and urban communities. With each passing year, this repository of content - videos, games and applications has grown to cater to the interests and engagement of children. 
Translating videos into 11 regional languages helped us become relevant and accessible to learners in all states. Moving forward we are planning to create a mass dissemination mechanism where with the help of content repository, parents and learners can take necessary content on to their android devices.

In this effort to make engaging content reach learners across India, Pratham has been actively collaborating with youth driven start-ups, content creators and interest groups.
