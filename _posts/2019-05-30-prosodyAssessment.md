**Objective:** Create an automated diagnostic tool to measure prosodic skills of children’s oral reading

**Concept:** To develop test tools for the effective and comprehensive assessment of prosody of children's oral reading in English as well as Indic languages.

**Issues addressed:** Accurate perception and production of the ranging aspects of prosody are a significant component of successful social communication. The need of trained evaluators for the same, puts a limit on the number of children that can be evaluated. Without a diagnostic evaluation it is difficult for teachers to provide learning content according to the child’s need.

**Details:**  Pitch, duration, and stress are the phonetic correlates of prosody. The physical correlates of these features are the speech’s fundamental frequency (F0), syllable duration, and intensity, respectively. Phonological correlates of prosody include the variations in pitch, length, and loudness that are produced in speech for conveying subtle changes in the meaning of spoken messages independent of words and grammatical order. In other words, stress and intonation are used to convey the grammatical, affective, and pragmatic functions of language. We aim to design a model in which the functions of prosody are identified at the grammatical and affective levels of communication. 

The grammatical functions of prosody include:

(a) determining the boundaries of phrases, clauses, or sentences, particularly when there is ambiguity (e.g., /FRUIT, SALAD and MILK/ vs. /FRUIT-SALAD and MILK/) and 

(b) differentiating between word classes when there are homonyms (e.g., a noun and verb that sound the same but are differentiated by prosody). 

The affective function of prosody is the use of prosodic features such as pitch contour, pauses, and word stress to express the speaker’s emotions and attitudes. Prosodic patterns convey different emotions. Happiness, for example, is characterized by a fast speaking rate, rising pitch, high variability, and fast voice onsets, and sadness is nearly the opposite. Such models could help teachers identify which students are making adequate progress.
