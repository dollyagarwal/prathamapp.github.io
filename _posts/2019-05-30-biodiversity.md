**Objective:** To help children enhance their interest, awareness and knowledge of their local biodiversity

**Concept:** Children can check out local biodiversity wherever they are with an app that says all about the species of animals and plants they find.

**Issues addressed:** Children are natural born explorers. Children wonder which species of bird it is that they keep seeing in their village. They want to know more about the mammals that call their surroundings. They keep asking their parents or elders nearby but get limited information about the same. We need an app that can help children quickly and easily identify flora and fauna, record their findings and learn more about them.

**Tech Needs:**

**Details:**
With a novel modelling and mapping platform covering tens of thousands of species -- everything from mammals and birds to plants, amphibians, reptiles, and fish, the app presents localised species detailed information. This system will enable children search through and learn more about the species they just spotted. They can just take photo and the app will run wikipedia for them. Moreover, it can be used to scroll through the photographs, learn more about the species, and also see which more species live nearby their villages.
