**Objective:** To enhance verbal communication skills through exposure to conversation flows

**Concept:** Develop a tool where children can learn verbal communication skills through exposure to conversation flows

**Issues addressed:** Verbal communication skills improve through practice and also when real time feedback is provided to the learner. The unavailability of teachers/trainers in rural parts of the country is a big barrier to achieving this important job and life skill.

**Details:**
The app allows users to learn and practice their language skills by learning new words and grammar lessons through conversation. By having a chatbot with which they can have a conversation, children can not only build their vocabulary and grammar but also understand how to use the words in a conversation by practising it. The basic aim is to expose learner to conversation scenarios on a speech enabled chatbot like tool. Then use Natural language processing to provide real time feedback on pronunciation, grammar, choice of words etc. for learner response.
