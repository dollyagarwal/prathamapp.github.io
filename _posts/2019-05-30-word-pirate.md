**Objective:** To help children build their vocabulary in any language

**Concept:** To identify text from different objects and save those words as part of building the vocabulary 

**Issues addressed:** Building a language vocabulary is a daunting task. We need a fun way to keep the kids inquisitive to keep searching for new words and understanding their meaning and context, which will help building their vocabulary.

**Details:**
Every day children come across a lot of objects which have text written over them. If they just start paying attention to these text and their meaning, it can help build a childâ€™s vocabulary. The app intents to generate curiosity in children to look for new texts on different objects they come across, click a picture of the object and upload on the app. The app will identify the text written over it, give its meaning and also translation in the native language. They can then save those words and start building their vocabulary.
