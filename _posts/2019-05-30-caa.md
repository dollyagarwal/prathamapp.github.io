**Objective:** To automate assessment of long-form answers/essays

**Concept:** To develop an automated system which can evaluate essays or long form answers in Indic languages

**Issues addressed:** Essay questions along with open-ended questions requiring short/long answers are designed to measure subject knowledge and writing ability. They are highly-valued components of effective assessment programs, but the expense and logistics of scoring them reliably often present a barrier to their use.

**Tech Needs:**

**Details:**
Automatic  evaluation  is  preferred  to manual assessment  to  avoid  monotonic,  bias  errors  and conserves time  for  other activities.  Hence automatic assessment is vital for educational system.  Keyword  analysis, natural-language processing and Information mining techniques are  the main approaches  adopted  for  text  assessment.
